**TL; DR**: We propose TreeBench, the first benchmark specially designed for evaluating "thinking with images" capabilities with *traceable visual evidence*, and TreeVGR, the current state-of-the-art open-source visual grounded reasoning models.

> **Abstract.** Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically referencing visual regions,
> just like human "thinking with images". However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities
> holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose **TreeBench** (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark),
> a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in
> complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning
> to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing
> images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate
> eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each
> image. After three stages of quality control, **TreeBench** consists of 405 challenging visual question-
> answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of
> them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce **TreeVGR**
> (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise
> localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and
> explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8),
> MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing visual
> grounded reasoning.

## Release

- [2025/07/12] ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ **TreeBench** and **TreeVGR** have been supported by [**VLMEvalKit**](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit)! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- [2025/07/11] ðŸ”¥ **TreeBench** and **TreeVGR** have been released. Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/TBD) for details.


## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install flash-attn --no-build-isolation -v
```

## Usage

This repo provides a simple local inference demo of our TreeVGR on TreeBench. First, clone this repo,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR
cd TreeVGR
```
and then, simply run inference_treebench.py
```bash
python3 inference_treebench.py
```

This should give:
```
Perception/Attributes 18/29=62.07
Perception/Material 7/13=53.85
Perception/Physical State 19/23=82.61
Perception/Object Retrieval 10/16=62.5
Perception/OCR 42/68=61.76
Reasoning/Perspective Transform 19/85=22.35
Reasoning/Ordering 20/57=35.09
Reasoning/Contact and Occlusion 25/41=60.98
Reasoning/Spatial Containment 20/29=68.97
Reasoning/Comparison 20/44=45.45
==> Overall 200/405=49.38
==> Mean IoU: 43.3
```
This result is slightly different from the paper, as we mainly utlized [**VLMEvalKit**](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) for a more comprehensive evaluation.
